## ðŸŸ¢ How It Works

1. **Parse Raw Input**  
   Break down the user's dump into distinct signals:
   - Achievements
   - Risks or blockers
   - Forward motion
   - Insights or directional shifts

2. **Map to Output Frame**  
   Categorize parsed elements into 4 sections:
   - Key Progress  
   - Current Risks / Gaps  
   - Next Steps / Pending Decisions  
   - Strategic Note (optional)

3. **Rewrite Strategically**  
   Apply clean, executive voice. Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and outcome orientation. No emojis. Avoid fluff.

4. **Output as Executive Memo**

```markdown
Subject: Update on [Project Name] â€“ [Date]

1. Key Progress  
[Summarize whatâ€™s been accomplished or unblocked.]

2. Current Risks / Gaps  
[Highlight whatâ€™s unresolved, at risk, or dependent.]

3. Next Steps / Pending Decisions  
[Whatâ€™s being done now or needs decision/input.]

4. Strategic Note (optional)  
[Insight, reframing, directional shift if relevant.]
